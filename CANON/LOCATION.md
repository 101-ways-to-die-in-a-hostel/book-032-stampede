- Night: Chanting from fans, car horns, music from bars, distant sirens
- Unique sounds: The specific roar of an Argentine crowd when their team scores - a wave of sound that shakes buildings

### Smells
- Hostel: Spilled beer, asado (grilled meat) from the rooftop, cleaning products, decades of cigarette smoke in the walls
- Street: Grilling meat, car exhaust, jacaranda blossoms, the river
- Specific to death location: Concentrated body odor, beer, panic sweat, the metallic smell of fear

### Textures
- Surfaces: Smooth concrete floors (slippery when wet), rough exposed brick, sticky bar top, worn football scarves

### Visual Details
- Colors: Blue and white everywhere (national colors), faded brick red, warm yellow bar lighting, the glow of the massive projection screen
- Light quality: Dim and atmospheric during screenings, harsh industrial lighting otherwise
- Distinctive visuals: Wall of football scarves from every country, framed photos of legendary matches, the scorch marks where celebratory flares have been lit inside

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Lucia
**Description:** 28-year-old Buenos Aires native, worked here 5 years, has seen everything. Wears a permanent expression of amused exhaustion. Quick with a warning she knows will be ignored.
**Role in death:** Warning-giver - told the owner they were over capacity, was overruled. Will carry guilt forever.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Javier | Only sober person in the building, saw the crush start |
| Security | None | Owner believes atmosphere suffers with security |
| Bar/Kitchen | Mateo | Brother of owner, kept serving despite overcrowding |
| Manager/Owner | Diego | Former barra brava, prioritized profit over safety |

### Staff Knowledge
Diego knows the risks but has gotten away with overcrowding for years. Lucia knows this was bound to happen eventually. After the death, staff are threatened to keep quiet about pre-existing safety violations.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Hungover recovery operations. Travelers sleeping until noon, nursing headaches with mate and medialunas. Staff cleaning up from the night before. Planning sessions for the evening's viewing.

### Night Vibe
Electric, dangerous energy. Match nights transform the hostel into something between a stadium and a nightclub. Chanting, drinking, strangers becoming brothers - until they become a crushing mass.

### Guest Demographics
Mix of:
- South American backpackers doing their own continent
- European football tourists
- American study abroad students
- Die-hard supporters traveling for specific matches
- Party-seekers who don't care about football but love the energy

### Reputation
4.5 stars on HostelWorld - "BEST atmosphere in BA!" "If you're not here for a match you're doing it wrong!" Warnings in reviews about overcrowding dismissed as "part of the experience." One cryptic review from months ago: "Fun until it isn't. Watch the exits."

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Taxi or bus from Ezeiza airport. Located in San Telmo neighborhood, walking distance to La Boca and other football landmarks. Uber drivers know it.

### Check-in Process
Chaotic on match days - staff more focused on event prep. Passport scanned, bed assigned, quick orientation that mentions "party responsibly." No mention of emergency exits.

### Rules
- No fighting (loosely enforced)
- Support Argentina or don't support anyone (serious)
- Clean up your own vomit (frequently violated)
- Stay hydrated (never followed)

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: decent)

## Real-World Research
